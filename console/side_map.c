/**
 *    Name:        side_map.c
 *    Description: the race's route map beside it (a tall screen's room under the picture): the right seat,
 *                 unseen with one player, shows the game's close-up route map, its car as far along the
 *                 route as the left seat's car is
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     30-10-2026
 *    Modified:    30-10-2026

 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    The scene is the console's own game mode on the right seat's screen (console.c), while the left seat
 *    races alone on the game's route (ARCADE, TIME ATTACK): the close-up map route_map_update drives the
 *    player's car over after a race (its states 3-14), with its tilemap, palette, sea and landmarks (the
 *    game's route_map_landmark objects), the car and the C.P signs the console's objects in the game's
 *    pictures. The map is the one of the route's first branch (its background, start and landmarks are by
 *    it): the east's until the first checkpoint decides it. The drive is route_map_update's, leg by leg:
 *    up from the start, then each level's stage across the map and the branch road after it up or down by
 *    the fork's branch, as far as the left car is into its stage (its course, then its branch road) and
 *    at most a step a frame, as the game's map drives; the car waits at a checkpoint until the fork is
 *    decided. The port draws the screen in the room (console_side_map_shown).
