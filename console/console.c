 *    Description: the console build's own versions of the game functions console/replaced.txt lists, and

 *    Version:     0.1.0

 *    The console build runs the arcade game's program with these in place of the game's own (whose
 *    definitions tools/decompile.py writes as CONSOLE_ORIGINAL(name): original_name here, for these to call):
 *    one player on the left seat's screen, free play, one sound for both speakers, and the title's menu
 *    (menu.c) in place of the start button.
