/**
 *    Name:        routes.c
 *    Description: & KNUCKLES' routes: REVERSE, from a goal the player picks back to the pre-stage, and FULL,
 *                 the 31 stages one after another from the pre-stage to the last goal
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     29-10-2026
 *    Modified:    29-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos

 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    The game builds its road from a course (stage_courses: a stage's runs, then its fork's two branches,
 *    each a short branch road that jumps to the next stage's course) and starts the roadside objects from a
 *    stream a stage (road_object_streams), both read through data_at. The routes give it courses of their
 *    own, at addresses the program has no data at (data_elsewhere): each stage's runs as they are, then a
 *    fork whose two branches lead where the route goes, through copies of the game's branch roads; the
 *    game's own course builder then takes the route (the fork's stages into route_stage, its STAGE label,
 *    palettes, arrow), and the roadside objects follow each stage's own stream.
 *
 *    REVERSE: each fork leads to the stage's parents (the stages whose forks lead to it: fork_next_stages);
 *    the goal stages fork where their goal was; the pre-stage finishes where its fork was, with a long run
 *    after it, as the goals do. A goal stage, where REVERSE starts, has a stream of its own here: the
 *    pre-stage's start line among its objects before its goal's approach, then stage 1's fork objects (its
 *    camera, sign, flags, flagman, checkpoint gate) moved to the new fork, and stage 1's branch streams
 *    moved with them. The pre-stage, where it finishes, has its finish where its fork was (the track's
 *    choice), with a goal stage's finish objects in place of the fork's.
 *
 *    FULL: both branches of each fork lead to the next stage by number (1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1 ...), through the
 *    stage's own branch roads; the goal stages fork where their goal was, as REVERSE's do, but the last
 *    (KENYA), which keeps its goal. The game counts the checkpoints passed (the forks 0-4, then the goal 5:
 *    the time each adds, the route, the split times are kept by them) and its times in hundredths of 16
 *    bits; once the car is in a stage, FULL takes the counts back to the stage's level (a goal stage's to the
 *    last fork's: the game's fifth is its goal), and the time to the last checkpoint out of the race's time
 *    into a total of its own, so that the race always is one the game knows. The goal shows the total.
 *
 *    The background of each stage is its own (stage_backgrounds), the pre-stage keeps the one before it (it
 *    has none); each fork adds the time of the stage it leads to; there is no route map after the race and
 *    no course record (the game's are by goal).
