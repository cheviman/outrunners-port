/**
 *    Name:        ghost.c
 *    Description: & KNUCKLES > TIME ATTACK's ghost: the fastest run kept, a goal each, and raced again
 *                 beside the player as a see-through car
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     29-10-2026
 *    Modified:    29-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos
 *
 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    The game draws each car of a race (race_cars_start: a race_car, its driver and passenger and their two
 *    gestures) from its player's race record copy (world place, segment, speed, animation, frame, sprays):
 *    in a race of two seats the other seat's car is drawn that way. A TIME ATTACK run keeps the car part of
 *    the left seat's record (0x30-0x6F) at each of its frames from the start (race_started), and the run that
 *    reaches a goal faster than the one kept for it is written to that goal's file (ghost_N.bin, in the
 *    game's folder). The next TIME ATTACK races the fastest of them again: one more race_car and its riders,
 *    from the record copy of a player no race on one cabinet has (player 2), which the ghost's frames fill in
 *    time with the race; it is not one of the race's players, so it neither collides, nor decides the route,
 *    nor has a place. Its objects run through a handler of the console's that runs theirs and marks the
 *    sprites they put in the list as a ghost (S32_SPRITE_GHOST: the video draws them half see-through). On a
 *    stage the ghost is not on (another route) it is not drawn.
