# Name:        anbernic.cmake
# Description: the build for Anbernic's H700 handhelds (the RG40XX H...) on their stock firmware: the console
#              game alone, as Roms/PORTS' OutRunners.sh and its folder outrunners/
# Version:     0.1.0
# Created:     30-10-2026
# Modified:    30-10-2026
# Author:      Sebastian Toyos
#
# Included by CMakeLists.txt with ORUNNERS_ANBERNIC (and the toolchain zig_aarch64.cmake: aarch64, glibc 2.35),
# as SegaSonic's port does. The game is the console build with its picture fixed (ORUNNERS_HANDHELD: the
# whole screen, the game's 4:3 picture, the video on the four cores; no VIDEO, no 2 PLAYERS), CONTROLS for its
# own buttons (ORUNNERS_CONTROLS_PAGE), the handheld's MENU and volume keys (ORUNNERS_HANDHELD_KEYS), and with
# the firmware's SDL2: the executable is linked against a stand-in of its name (sdl2_stub.c) and SDL's headers
# (ORUNNERS_SDL2_INCLUDE, by default the development package in build/downloads/sdl2). The build is PORTS's
# files without the assets, in build/bin/anbernic: the handheld makes nothing from the ROM set, and
# OutRunners Anbernic (ports/anbernic/maker), on the player's computer, writes PORTS from them and the
# player's ROM set.
