# Name:        android.cmake
# Description: the Android build (the NDK's toolchain): the console game as libmain.so beside SDL2's, both from
#              their source, and the APKs around them: the game's, for OutRunners APK, and this computer's own
# Version:     0.1.0
# Created:     30-10-2026
# Modified:    31-10-2026
# Author:      Sebastian Toyos
#
# Included by CMakeLists.txt when the toolchain is the NDK's (build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake, with
# ANDROID_ABI and ANDROID_PLATFORM), as SegaSonic's port does. The game is the console build with its picture
# fixed and WIDE (ORUNNERS_HANDHELD, ORUNNERS_SCREEN_WIDE), no EXIT in its menu (ORUNNERS_SYSTEM_EXIT: Android's
# home leaves it) and the touch screen's controls (ORUNNERS_TOUCH), in libmain.so, which SDL's activity starts
# (its Java, from SDL's source). The APKs are put together without Gradle, by the SDK's own tools: javac and
# d8 (the Java), aapt2 (the manifest, the icon, the assets), aapt (the libraries and the Java in), zipalign
# and apksigner. Android makes nothing from the ROM set: an APK carries the assets pack taken out of the
# player's ROM set on a computer, so it is its player's alone and never shared. Two of them:
#   build/bin/android/outrunners-base.apk   the game without a pack or a signature: OutRunners APK
#                                           (ports/android/apk) makes the player's APK of it, on their computer
#   build/bin/android/OutRunners-debug.apk   this computer's own, with its pack (build/bin/outrunners.assets),
#                                           signed with the debug key of its Android tools
#                                           (~/.android/debug.keystore, which keytool makes when there is none;
#                                           the same key each time, so a new APK installs over the last one and
#                                           keeps what the game wrote)
