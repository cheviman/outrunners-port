# Name:        switch.cmake
# Description: the Nintendo Switch build (devkitPro's toolchain): the console game alone, as the pieces of its
#              .nsp (the NSO, main.npdm, the NACP and the icon) and, where the assets pack is, as OutRunners.nro
# Version:     0.1.0
# Created:     30-10-2026
# Modified:    30-10-2026
# Author:      Sebastian Toyos
#
# Included by CMakeLists.txt when the toolchain is the Switch's (aarch64-none-elf-cmake), as SegaSonic's port
# does. The game is the same console build as on a computer, with SDL2 for the Switch (switch-sdl2, devkitPro's
# portlibs), its picture fixed and WIDE (ORUNNERS_HANDHELD, ORUNNERS_SCREEN_WIDE), its controls fixed, 2 PLAYERS
# side by side with a second controller (ORUNNERS_TWO_PLAYERS) and no EXIT in its menu (ORUNNERS_SYSTEM_EXIT:
# HOME leaves it). The Switch makes nothing from the ROM set: the game reads its assets pack from its own romfs,
# which a computer fills with the player's (the .nsp, made there with the player's keys; or, where the build has
# the pack beside the executables, build/bin/outrunners.assets, the .nro for the Homebrew Menu, the player's own
# and never shared).
