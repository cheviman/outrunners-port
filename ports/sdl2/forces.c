/**
 *    Name:        forces.c
 *    Description: the forces the controllers give back: a racing wheel's centring spring, and the cabinet's
 *                 wheel motor as a wheel's shake, a game controller's rumble or a phone's vibration
 *    Version:     0.1.1
 *    Created:     06-11-2026

 *    The cabinet's wheel came back to the centre on a spring of its own: the game never pushes it there. The
 *    one force the board drives is the wheel's motor, on or off (output port D bit 4 of each seat's I/O chip,
 *    while the test mode's STEERING WHEEL REACTION is on), which shakes the wheel in a crash and off the road
 *    (src/race/player_car.c, player_car_off_road_shake). A racing wheel with force feedback (a Thrustmaster
 *    T300RS, a Logitech G29) gives no force the game does not ask for, so with nothing asked it turns loose:
 *    this asks it for the cabinet's spring, and for the motor's shake while the motor runs.
 *    - the spring: SDL's spring effect (SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING) at 'centring' percent of the wheel's strongest,
 *      round the wheel's centre, for as long as the game runs; where the wheel has none, its autocentre
 *      (SDL_HAPTIC_AUTOCENTER) at that strength.
 *    - the shake: a sine (SDL_HAPTIC_SINE, SHAKE_PERIOD) at 'shake' percent of the wheel's strongest while the
 *      motor runs. A device with no sine (a game controller: an Xbox, a DualSense...) rumbles instead.
 *    A device is looked at once, the first frame it is a player's game controller with a force wanted: its
 *    haptic is kept where it has one of those effects, and closed where it has none (a game controller's,
 *    whose rumble is SDL's game controller rumble). SDL opening a haptic turns the device's own autocentre off,
 *    so with CENTRING at 0 and VIBRATION at 0 the haptic is not opened at all and the wheel is as its driver
 *    leaves it. The effects go along the wheel's one axis (SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, 1: DirectInput takes no polar
 *    direction for a device of one axis).
 *
 *    A player with no game controller plays on the device itself (a phone's touch controls): the device's own
 *    vibrator, which SDL lists on Android as a haptic of its own named VIBRATOR_SERVICE (rumble only), vibrates
 *    while the motor runs. Android starts a vibration again at each call (vibrate), so it is asked for a span
 *    longer than a few frames (VIBRATOR_SPAN) and again before it ends (VIBRATOR_RENEW frames), and stopped
 *    as the motor stops.
