/**
 *    Name:        main.c
 *    Description: the game in a window: SDL2 shows its screens, plays its sound, reads the controls and
 *                 keeps the pace, around the same game and board the headless runs check
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     21-10-2026
 *    Modified:    30-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos
 *
 *    license:BSD-3-Clause
 *    Usage: "OutRunners Arcade" or OutRunners [--script FILE [--fast]] [--hashes FILE] [--video-hashes FILE]
 *                    [--sound-hashes FILE] [--assets FOLDER]
 *
 *    The game (src/) and the board (runtime/) run as they are: this file only wraps them. Where the board
 *    has its hooks, the port does its part: when VBLANK starts the video draws both screens and the port
 *    puts them in the window, the left screen beside the right (the console version, OutRunners: the left
 *    one alone, both in 2 PLAYERS); when the board reads the controls the port hands it the keyboard and
 *    the game controllers; when the game finishes a frame the port queues the frame's sound and waits for
 *    the frame's time (60 a second) to pass. What the board keeps with the power off is kept in two files,
 *    beside the executable on Windows and in the user's folder for the game elsewhere (saves_folder):
 *    orunners.eeprom the EEPROM (the settings and their copy), orunners.bookkeeping the part of the sound
 *    board's RAM the game keeps on the battery (the bookkeeping, the ten course records and the credits
 *    among it, its checksum and its copy); the console version's are outrunners.eeprom and
 *    outrunners.bookkeeping.
 *
 *    The game's data is its assets (game/assets.h), the files extract_assets.py writes from the player's
 *    ROM set: --assets, or the folder 'assets' beside the executable, beside the .app on macOS, in the
 *    folder of what the game keeps, or in the current folder. Where there is none, the first run takes them
 *    out of the ROM set itself into the folder of what the game keeps (first_run.c, runtime/src/extract.c):
 *    orunners.zip or rom/ beside the game or in that folder, or a set dropped on its window.
 *
 *    The game devices (ORUNNERS_HANDHELD) make nothing from the ROM set: their assets pack (outrunners.assets)
 *    comes with the game, made on a computer, and their picture is fixed (fix_window_settings). On Anbernic's
 *    handhelds it is beside the executable, where the game keeps what it writes; on the Switch it is in the
 *    .nro's or the .nsp's romfs, and what the game writes goes to /switch/outrunners/ on the SD card, with
 *    outrunners.log.
 *
 *    --script plays a control script (runtime/include/s32/script.h) instead of the keyboard, to its end,
 *    from a blank EEPROM and sound RAM that it does not keep; --fast runs it without waiting for the frames'
 *    time.
 *    --hashes, --video-hashes and --sound-hashes write for each frame the hashes ports/headless and
 *    tools/core/system32/reference/s32ref write, so a script run in the window compares with the reference
 *    frame by frame.
 *
 *    Controls (the cabinet's player 1; player 2 on the second game controller):
 *      left, right arrows             the wheel (it comes back to the centre when let go)
 *      up arrow, down arrow           gas, brake
 *      Q, A                           shift up, shift down
 *      space                          DJ (the music)      [ ]    << and >> (the song)
 *      5, 6                           coins 1-2           1, 2   starts 1-2
 *      9                              service             F2     test (the operator's menu)
 *      Escape                         quit                F11 or Alt+Enter   full screen
 *      F3                             smooth or sharp pixels
 *    Game controllers: the left stick is the wheel, the right trigger the gas, the left trigger the brake,
 *    the right and left shoulders shift up and down, Y the DJ, the pad's left and right << and >>, Start
 *    the start, Back a coin.
